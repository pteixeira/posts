Youtube removed the categorization of the channels you subscribe for some reason, which may make managing your subscriptions somewhat chaotic, specially if you have a lot of them.

So I'm developing a way of dealing with that, along with also managing your reddit saved posts (in case you don't have reddit gold :P) so I can become more familiar with working with different APIs
